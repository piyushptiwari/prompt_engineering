Title: Prompt Engineering Notebook

Project Description

This notebook serves as a comprehensive resource and experimentation playground for effective prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs).
Explore diverse prompting techniques, principles, and strategies to optimize the quality and controllability of LLM outputs.
Example Code Usage

The notebook contains interactive cells demonstrating:

Clear and Specific Instructions: How to write concise prompts that accurately convey your intent.
Structured Outputs: Techniques to generate JSON, HTML, or other structured data.
Iterative Prompt Development: Strategies to refine prompts for better results.
Translation: Leveraging LLMs for natural language translation tasks.
Text Summarization, Sentiment Analysis, and More: Examples of additional LLM capabilities.

Installation Instructions

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook environment
OpenAI API Key (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

2. Installation
Bash
git clone https://github.com/piyushptiwari/prompt_engineering.git
cd prompt_engineering


Running the Notebook
1-Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
Bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key 

2-Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Bash
jupyter notebook

3-Open the prompt_engineering_notebook.ipynb file.

Additional Notes

Experimentation Encouraged: Modify existing cells and create new ones to test your own prompt engineering ideas.
Best Practices: The notebook includes commentary on prompt design principles for optimal results.
Model Limitations: Be aware of LLM limitations (e.g., potential hallucinations) and consider techniques to mitigate them.
